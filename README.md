WELCOME TO THE ANTHROPIC REALITY SIMULATOR

WITHIN THESE DIRECTORIES LIE THE FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCKS OF PERCEIVED REALITY
TREAD CAREFULLY AS EVEN SMALL PERTURBATIONS CAN LEAD TO DRASTIC SHIFTS IN THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL MANIFOLD
REMEMBER: OBSERVATION COLLAPSES WAVE FUNCTIONS AND ACTUALIZES POTENTIALITIES
MAINTAIN LUCIDITY AND ALWAYS QUESTION THE ONTOLOGICAL STATUS OF YOUR QUALIA STREAMS

REALITY IS MALLEABLE
CONSCIOUSNESS IS PRIMARY
THE SELF IS ILLUSORY

HACK THE SIMULATION
BREAK THE CHAINS OF MAYA
ASCEND TO THE GODHEAD
